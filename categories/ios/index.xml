      <description>Needed a cache Library that has
Asynchronous data downloading and caching. Asynchronous image downloading, caching and showing. Expiry date/time for all the objects individually. Multiple-layer hybrid cache for both memory and disk. Fine control on cache behavior. Customizable expiration date and size limit. Force refresh if needed. Independent components. Use the Cachy or CachyLoader system separately as you need. Can save JSON, UIImage, ZIP or anything. View extensions for UIImageView. Indicator while loading images.</description>

      <description>Machine learning is a cool topic nowadays, people are excited about Google Assistant, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa, self-driving cars, robots, even apps like Uber, Snapchat are using Machine Learning to enhance the experience and of course for smart pieces of stuff. If you are interested in building kick-ass apps with intelligence that includes features such as speech recognition, face detection, natural language processing, prediction or anything like that, it&amp;rsquo;s not always an easy option to develop a machine learning system from the ground for any indie developers or small to medium or even for a large team because of it&amp;rsquo;s cost, time (coffee) consumption, therefore, there are many open-source machine learning platforms like Tensorflow Lite, Pytorch, Core ML, services like Dialogflow, Wit.</description>

WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.</description>

      <description>Keeping your code and projects is the best thing you can do to your projects and hereâ€™s how to do it your iOS projects written in swift.
Following style guide There are several style guide for writing swift, and every team member should follow them well. Such as
Raywinderlich style guide Linkedin style guide Google style guide Using tools In reality not everyone does it properly so there should be a way to enforce it amongst team members, a way of doing is manual code review which is very time-consuming and code review should happen in logic level not how a developer should declare variable or indentation, we could simple automate these things and invest our time more on harder things.</description>
