      <description>Null safety is the solution to the billion doller mistake and it&amp;rsquo;s available for Flutter as well, why live with billion doller mistake anymore!
As null safety is available with Flutter 2.0 It comes with pretty handy migration guide and can simply use the tool to migrate to null safety nicely.
But in reality it&amp;rsquo;s not that straight forward as it sounds for a medium to big projects, also there might be lots of third party dependencies and tool may produce lots of compile error (atleast it happened with me).</description>
