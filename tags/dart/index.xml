      <description>After the first release Flutter is being too obvious to avoid it, lots of people are talking about flutter, and the technology behind it is interesting enough to check out. I liked how it performs(a lot faster than other cross-platform competitors), documentation is also good, so I decided to give it a try. But I&amp;rsquo;m not fully satisfied with the installation procedure, You have to read a few paragraphs to just install but that could have been done through Homebrew / APT / Nuget or whatever(any other package manager) However unofficially it is possible to install Flutter through Homebrew on Mac.</description>
