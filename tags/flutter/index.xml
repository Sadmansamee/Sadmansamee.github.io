      <description>Null safety is the solution to the billion doller mistake and it&amp;rsquo;s available for Flutter as well, why live with billion doller mistake anymore!
As null safety is available with Flutter 2.0 It comes with pretty handy migration guide and can simply use the tool to migrate to null safety nicely.
But in reality it&amp;rsquo;s not that straight forward as it sounds for a medium to big projects, also there might be lots of third party dependencies and tool may produce lots of compile error (atleast it happened with me).</description>

      <description>Update We already rewrote our app, and it&amp;rsquo;s the best idea. We develope new features once and ship everywhere, and our bug fixing and testing effort reduced in a great number. We dont have to fix different bugs on different places and same goes for testing efforts as well.

      <description>After the first release Flutter is being too obvious to avoid it, lots of people are talking about flutter, and the technology behind it is interesting enough to check out. I liked how it performs(a lot faster than other cross-platform competitors), documentation is also good, so I decided to give it a try. But I&amp;rsquo;m not fully satisfied with the installation procedure, You have to read a few paragraphs to just install but that could have been done through Homebrew / APT / Nuget or whatever(any other package manager) However unofficially it is possible to install Flutter through Homebrew on Mac.</description>
